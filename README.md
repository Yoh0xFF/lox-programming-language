# Lox Programming Language

This project is written following the first part of the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) book.

It demonstrates how to implement the following concepts:

- tokens and lexing,
- abstract syntax trees,
- recursive descent parsing,
- prefix and infix expressions,
- runtime representation of objects,
- interpreting code using the Visitor pattern,
- lexical scope,
- environment chains for storing variables,
- control flow,
- functions with parameters,
- closures,
- static variable resolution and error detection,
- classes,
- constructors,
- fields,
- methods, and finally,
- inheritance.

## How to run

```bash
# Run in interactive dev mode
npm run start:dev

# Build and run in production mode 
npm run start

# We can pass file to execute as follows
npm run start file.lox
```
